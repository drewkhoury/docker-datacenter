# This Demo

This demo Installs Commercially Supported Docker in a [High Availability](https://docs.docker.com/ucp/understand_ha/) configuration. Included in this demo is UCP (Universal Control Plane), DTR (Docker Trusted Registry) and docker-compose.

- docker1 :: controller node (ucp+ca) + DTR containers
- docker2 :: replica node (ucp)
- docker3 :: replica node (ucp)

# I'm in the fast lane
```
wget https://packages.docker.com/caas/ucp-1.1.2_dtr-2.0.2.tar.gz

git clone git@github.com:drewkhoury/docker-datacenter.git
cd docker-datacenter
touch docker_subscription.lic # add a valid `docker_subscription.lic` file https://hub.docker.com/enterprise/trial/
vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
vagrant up
```

- UCP=[https://docker1:8443/](https://docker1:8443/) (login details `admin/orca`).
- DTR=[https://docker1:1337/](https://docker1:1337/) (login details `admin/adminadmin`).

# Requirments

- A valid `docker_subscription.lic` file for the demo
- VirtualBox
- Vagrant & Vagrant Plugins `vagrant-proxyconf` and `vagrant-hostmanager`
- 5.5GB memory & 20GB disk space free on your workstation
- If you require a proxy on your workstation (e.g you're running cntlm)...
	- review `LOCAL_PROXY` in `Vagrantfile`

# Steps

Obtain a docker license file by visiting https://hub.docker.com/enterprise/trial/. Put your `docker_subscription.lic` file in the root of this repo.

The `vagrant up` command will bring up all 3 VMs and provision them with Docker Datacenter.

```
git clone git@github.com:drewkhoury/docker-datacenter-demo.git
cd docker-datacenter-demo
vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
vagrant up
```

All Guest VMs obtain thier IPs dynamically, and have hostname entries in `/etc/hosts` files. Your Host Machine will also have it's host file set due to the Vagrantfile config `config.hostmanager.manage_host = true` and you may be prompted to allow access to your hosts file.

**Example Output:**
```
